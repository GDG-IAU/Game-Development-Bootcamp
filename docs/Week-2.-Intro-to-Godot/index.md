# Introduction

## Overview

In this week, we're going to cover various game engine concepts, and get you started on using the Godot game engine to create games.

It's worth noting that this week is **extremely important** as it will cover all of the *fundamentals* of Godot and how to use it to create games. The following weeks will mostly be about how you can *apply* these fundamentals to create different types of games, and practicing upon them.

If you don't understand the basics of Godot, it will be much harder for you to progress in this bootcamp and have a clear understanding of what's going on, and your creativity will be limited too because of it.

Thankfully, Godot is extremely simple to use and understand, so if you just focus with us a little in this week, you will be far better prepared to take on the coming weeks and unlock your full potential as a game developer using Godot.
