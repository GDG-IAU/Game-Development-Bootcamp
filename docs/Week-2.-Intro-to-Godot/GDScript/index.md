# GDScript

## What is GDScript?

Behind every game, there is a programming language that powers it. GDScript is the one that’s custom-made for Godot. It is simple, clutter-free, and tightly integrated with the engine, with its creators deeming it easy for beginners to learn. It was created with the intent of helping users focus on the engine rather than on spending time learning how to integrate code written in other languages. It also enables developers to easily get rid of bugs in the engine code and effortlessly introduce new features. That being said, Godot also has support for other languages such as C++ and C#, among others, which are primarily supported by the Godot community.

## Scripting

A script is a piece of code that adds logic to a node, such as moving an image or deciding when to play that sound. To start scripting and trying out the examples given, you will need to create a new project, add a node to the scene, and attach a script to that node.
