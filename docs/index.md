Welcome to the Game Development Bootcamp of the Google Developer Groups (GDG) club at the Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University (IAU). Our main focus here is to train and prepare students to develop their own games, and help kick-off their career in game development.

## About Us

We're a group of passionate game developers eager to help others learn more about the wonders of game development and help develop their knowledge and skills. We try to create educational content that's fitting for both experienced developers and novices. Whether you're a seasoned expert of game development, or just starting your journey, there's a place for you here.

## What To Expect

We have created a 4 week course for aspiring game developers of the club to participate in. Each week will focus on a set of game development concepts and will have tutorials and live sessions to help develop the students skills. In addition to the general course, a group of students within the club will be specially selected to partake in "focus group" teams that will receive direct mentorship from the track's leaders and assistance in creating a demo for their own, unique game.

## The Plan

The course will last for 4 weeks. Each week will cover certain concepts, have live-coding sessions, and tasks for students to complete.
